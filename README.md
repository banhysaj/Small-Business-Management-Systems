What’s better than collecting data? Managing them!

Our topic and goal for this project has been to create a multi-purpose management system, this system can be integrated/implemented in many types of business and be accessed by different types of users, as mentioned later in the draft.

Having had first-hand experiences in lots of businesses whose main focus is serving/selling products to individual customers, keeping track of expenses, budget and sales is the foundation of a growing business.

As seen in the next slides we will be having a closer look at the technologies used, how they’re used and how we have made everything much easier for both the end user and the any other entities who will manage or use our program. 

Please note that this is an ongoing project where we aim to implement this in a real-life scenario, meaning that further changes may be necessary based on the way the business in question is run.
